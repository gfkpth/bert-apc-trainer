# APC test sentences

The files in this folder contain sentences coded for whether or not they contain an APC for additional model evaluation.

## Languages

For now, there is one set of sentences for German. Another one for English is to follow later.

## Methodology

The dataset `APCtest_GER_full.csv` is based on sentences originally generated using GPT-5 via ChatGPT with instructions along the lines below (and some additional prompting afterwards):

```
Adnominal pronoun constructions are phrases of the type *we linguists* or in German *wir glücklichen Kinder*, *du naiver Typ*, *ich Bahnfahrer* and similar. Generate a csv file with four headers example, APC, instance and condition. example shall contain example sentences, APC the precise string of the adnominal pronoun constructions (including any modifiers, e.g. *wir lustigen Kinder aus Bullerbü*) found in the example sentence and instance marks whether the example sentence contains an APC (value: 1) or not (value: 0). Conditions for example sentences containing APCs are coded by the following scheme: apc-[construction]-[person]-[number]-[modifiers]-[noun known] - 'apc' is an immutable prefix for examples containing an APC - [construction] has the following possible values: - subj if the APC is a sentential subject - obj if the APC is a direct object - PP if the APC is the complement of a preposition - external if the APC is not directly integrated in a sentence, but some kind of apposition or exclamation, e.g. '*Ihr dummen Schweine*, ihr habt das Aquarium kaputt gemacht!', 'So etwas haben wir gar nicht nötig, *wir cleveren Schreinerinnen aus Rostock*.', '*Ich Trottel*, jetzt habe ich den Herd angelassen!', 'Dir sollte man mal die Meinung geigen, *du unsensible Arschgeige*!' - [person] indicates the person of the APC with possible values "1", "2" and "2Hon" (for polite *Sie*) - [number] indicates the number of the APC with possible values "sg" (singular), "pl" (plural) - [modifiers] indicates what modifiers the APC contains with the following possible values: - 'nomod': there is no modifier - 'adj': there is an adjectival modifier (e.g. 'ich armer Trop') - 'postnom': there is a postnominal modifier, e.g. a PP (e.g. 'wir Kinder aus Büllerbü') or a genitive ('ihr Geschöpfe des Lichts') - 'adj+postnom': there is an adjectival modifer and a postnominal modifier - [noun known] indicates whether the head noun of the APC was included in the original dataset ('NinDS') or not ('Nnew') Generate the csv file with the following requirements:

 1) All example sentences are well-formed German sentences. 
 2) Generate 2 examples for each grammatical combinations defined above for construction, person, number and modifiers. The value "noun known" can vary across combinations, but overall pick about 60% from the list of nouns in the original dataset (and mark the condition code with the 'NinDS' marker) and for the remainder use nouns not contained in the dataset ('Nnew'). The new nouns can also include nominalised adjectives. Make sure that the field example contains the actual example sentence, the APC field contains the full APC , ìnstance is marked 1 and the construction field is filled in according to the definitions above. 
 3) Additionally generate 50 rows for example sentences that do *not* contain an APC. The APC field thus remains empty for these rows, the field instance is set to 0 and condition is set to 'noapc'. A large number of these examples shall contain pronouns and nouns adjacent to each other, but not actually forming a constituent (e.g. 'Ich wunderte mich, warum man *uns Kinder* nannte*). 
 4) Use an overall mix of about 50-50 of more colloquial and more neutral/formal examples.
```

The model initially generated python code to create the list, which lead to largely ungrammatical sentences. Additional prompting got the model to actually use the language model for generation of the target sentences. 
The results were still not very good, but provided a basis for manual reworking. I wanted to have a mix of lexical nouns contained in the training data and new head nouns, but this may have overly constrained the model. 

The results were manually checked, which led to the majority of the examples being changed. The columns `example-gpt` and `APC-gpt` retain the original sentence and APC generated by GPT-5. In order to also take a record of the quality of output from the original set of prompts, I tried to roughly indicate the problems with each sentence that was changed using the following categories:

- `grammar APCinflection`: set to 1 if there was a mistake in the morphological inflection of the APC, either the head noun or adjectival congruence (e.g "ich ehrlicher Kind" instead of "ich ehrliche**s** Kind"); I also marked this in cases where two alternative inflections are technically possible, but I felt the need to change the one employed by the model (e.g. "ihr kluge Ärzte" vs. "ihr kluge**n** Ärzte", where I preferred the latter in the given context)
- `grammar Vagreement`: set to 1 if verbal agreement was wrong; only applies where the APC is subject; example: "Du Narr **ist** gestern im Park spazieren gegangen" (2sg agreement was consistently not generated).
- `grammar other`: set to 1 for examples where there were other cases of grammatically based inconsistencies not directly in the APCs, e.g. "Viele Leute sahen mich Pole aus Berlin als Vorbilder in der Gemeinde" where *als Vorbilder* is plural, but the reference noun phrase *mich Pole* is singular.
- `grammar nonceword`: set to 1 for examples containing non-words. The most obvious case was the 2pl honorific form, which should be *Sie* just like for the 2sg honorific, but the model seemed to treat this as paradigmatic gap and generated, e.g. *None Franzosen*. I also marked examples with words like *Startupper*, which may in principle be possible neologisms, but are not idiomatic.
Initially, I also marked an instance of the word *Lauretz*, which did not make sense out of context, but was actually present in the training data (it's a surname).
- `issue meaning`: set to 1 if the meaning of the sentence was incoherent, implausible, contradictory, e.g. "Sie Gott ist seit Jahren aktiv in diesem Verein" or "Viele Leute sahen mich Stadt als Vorbilder in der Gemeinde"
- `changed for better coherence`: set to 1 if the sentence could be a syntactically and semantically well-formed sentence of German, but a reformulation or complete replacement still seemed indicated to provide a more plausible context to license the relevant type of APC

Some sentences may still sound a bit uncommon, but that will most likely be due to general restrictions on specifically singular APCs (not exhaustivly understood, but see Rauh, Gisa. 2004. Warum ``Linguist'' in ``ich/du Linguist'' kein Schimpfwort sein muß. Eine konversationstheoretische Erklärung. *Linguistische Berichte*, Vol. 197, pp. 77-105). As the aim for the detector should be to be able to identify also uncommon forms, and thus to have high recall, I'm including such slightly marked examples in this evaluation set as well.
